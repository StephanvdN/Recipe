INGREDIENTS

100 g Courgettes
300 g Self-raising flour
200 g coconut sugar or caster sugar
250 ml Non-dairy milk
zest and juice of 2.5 lemons
450 g vegan cream cheese
150 g icing sugar

INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat the oven to 180C fan/200°C/gas 6. Line a muffin tray with paper cases.
Put the milk into a jug with the zest and juice of 2 lemons and 100ml of sunflower oil. Mix and allow the milk to curdle for a few minutes. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the curdled milk. Bring together using a spatula until all the ingredients are combined.
Fold the grated courgette through the batter. Pour the batter into each muffin case, no more than three-quarters full. Bake in the oven for 20–25 minutes, rotating halfway through the cooking time.
Remove the cupcakes from the oven when they have risen and check that they are done by inserting a clean skewer into the centre – if the skewer comes out clean they are done, if not, put the cupcakes back into the oven for another 5 minutes or so. Allow to cool fully before icing.
For the icing, put the vegan cream cheese into a mixing bowl and use a whisk to break it up until smooth and creamy. Sieve in the icing sugar and juice of the remaining lemon half plus most of the zest. Whisk until smooth. Pop back into the fridge until you are ready to ice the cupcakes.
Simply frost each cupcake using a palette knife or a spatula. If you want pretty swirls, half fill a piping bag with a large star nozzle, or use a large freezer/sandwich bag and snip off about 1cm off one of the corners, and pipe a nice swirl on to each cupcake. Decorate with the rest of the lemon zest.

INGREDIENTS

Base
200 g Digestive biscuits
80 g coconut oil
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Filling
500 g pumpkin/squash (400g pumpkin puree)
400 g vegan creamed cheese
100 g coconut oil
140 g maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp ground cinnamon
2 tsp ground ginger
1 pinch salt
INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat oven to 180C
Peel the pumpkin and remove the seeds. Slice the flesh of the pumpkin into small bite sized pieces. Add them to a baking tray and bake for 25 minutes until cooked through.
Add the biscuits to the food processor and blend until they reach a breadcrumb like consistency (approx 1 minute). Add the coconut oil and vanilla extract (if using) and blend until incorporated (approx 30 seconds).
Transfer the blended base ingredients to a lined spring form cake tin or spring form pie dish. A spatula is easiest to ensure you get everything out of the food processor. Using a spoon spread it around evenly. Use the back of the spoon to compact it till it becomes firm and compact.
Wipe out the food processor. Add the roasted pumpkin to the food processor along with all the rest of the filling ingredients and blend until nice and smooth.
Using a silicon spatula transfer the filling onto of the base. Spread out so smooth and even.
Place in the fridge to set for 30 minutes. Finely chop the dark chocolate into small
