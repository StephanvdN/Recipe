INGREDIENTS

100 g Courgettes
300 g Self-raising flour
200 g coconut sugar or caster sugar
250 ml Non-dairy milk
zest and juice of 2.5 lemons
450 g vegan cream cheese
150 g icing sugar

INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat the oven to 180C fan/200°C/gas 6. Line a muffin tray with paper cases.
Put the milk into a jug with the zest and juice of 2 lemons and 100ml of sunflower oil. Mix and allow the milk to curdle for a few minutes. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the curdled milk. Bring together using a spatula until all the ingredients are combined.
Fold the grated courgette through the batter. Pour the batter into each muffin case, no more than three-quarters full. Bake in the oven for 20–25 minutes, rotating halfway through the cooking time.
Remove the cupcakes from the oven when they have risen and check that they are done by inserting a clean skewer into the centre – if the skewer comes out clean they are done, if not, put the cupcakes back into the oven for another 5 minutes or so. Allow to cool fully before icing.
For the icing, put the vegan cream cheese into a mixing bowl and use a whisk to break it up until smooth and creamy. Sieve in the icing sugar and juice of the remaining lemon half plus most of the zest. Whisk until smooth. Pop back into the fridge until you are ready to ice the cupcakes.
Simply frost each cupcake using a palette knife or a spatula. If you want pretty swirls, half fill a piping bag with a large star nozzle, or use a large freezer/sandwich bag and snip off about 1cm off one of the corners, and pipe a nice swirl on to each cupcake. Decorate with the rest of the lemon zest.
